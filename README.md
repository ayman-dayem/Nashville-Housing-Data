# Nashville-Housing-Data
worked with Nashville housing data sourced from various sources, including Kaggle and public datasets. Leveraging SQL Server, I conducted data wrangling tasks to clean, standardize, and prepare the dataset for analysis. Using SQL queries, I addressed data inconsistencies, handled missing values.
